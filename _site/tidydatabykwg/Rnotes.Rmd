# General Tips 

If you are new to R and or computer programming a challenging feature is learning to work with your working directory. Dealing with your working directory is easy once you have established the habit. 

1. Get or Set Working Directory

1. getwd()
2. setwd()

When working with a data frame and you create the script you can use the first script to set the working directory to the directory where the file is.

##  Read and Write Data

read.csv


write.csv(data, "name of file.csv", row.names=FALSE)

save()

load()
You can also save an R object to a file. This is very handy when you want to reference a data set with R markdown documents. In Markdown files the global environment is empty and needed to be loaded into the environment. This is both handy and annoying.
